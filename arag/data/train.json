Water quality \u2022 Piped water is available in some areas, but is often untreated or is contaminated between the source and the home. \u2022 Simple, low cost technologies for treating and safely storing water at the household level can greatly improve the microbial quality of water and can significantly reduce diarrhoea achieving outcomes comparable to those achieved by hand washing and safe handling and disposal of faeces. \u2022 Several technologies are viable for treating water in the home: chlo - rination; use of aqua safe and water guard, use of various types of filters; proper boiling.",

Food and nutrition security encompasses issues of food availability, access and utilization for maximum health benefits and social economic develop - ment. This can be achieved through enhanced agricultural productivity, proper farm management, agro-processing, marketing, community awareness, enhanced community and household capacity to withstand shocks and adapting appropriate practices that ensure better food utili - zation, for instance proper home care, personal hygiene, food prepara-tion and feeding practices. Improved food utilization can be achieved through a deliberate effort to integrate nutrition in all agriculture devel-opment programs. Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) supports households and communities to increase access to and consumption of diversified foods from their own production or purchase throughout the year. In addition, the Ministry plays an important role in reducing post-harvest losses and addressing issues related to women\u2019s workload within households. All this is aimed at improving nutrition among house - holds and communities and is in line with the Uganda Nutrition Action Plan (UNAP 2011\u20132016). However, malnutrition remains one of the main health and economic problems facing our country and has negative consequences on produc - tivity. The productivity lost when agriculture workers take time off to deal with malnutrition related illnesses or deaths in their families is enor - mous. For example, the loss caused by iron deficiency anaemia in adults alone is US$34 million worth of productivity (PROFILES, 2012).",

Iodine is important for thyroid function and for mental development of children. The most important dietary source is iodized salt. Zinc enhances and strengthens the immune system, helps wound healing, facilitates digestion and is an important component of skeletal muscle. Dietary sources include beef, seafood, liver, nuts, beans and whole grains.",

    "chunk": "Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: \u2022 Carbohydrates \u2022 Proteins \u2022 Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 \u20133000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.",

Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality.",

Food contains important substances which provide energy to move, think, work, run our body systems, keep us healthy, help to boost our immune system and protect us from infections. When we eat or take food, our bodies absorb useful nutrients into the blood and they are transported to areas where they are needed or stored. The food we eat or take is used for growth, maintenance and body functions. Classification of foods according to their functions Foods may be classified according to their functions in the body: a) Energy-giving foods (\u201cGO\u201d foods) Foods rich in carbohydrates and fats are called energy-giving foods or \u201cGO\u201d foods.

Food and nutrition security encompasses issues of food availability, access and utilization for maximum health benefits and social economic develop - ment. This can be achieved through enhanced agricultural productivity, proper farm management, agro-processing, marketing, community awareness, enhanced community and household capacity to withstand shocks and adapting appropriate practices that ensure better food utili - zation, for instance proper home care, personal hygiene, food prepara-tion and feeding practices. Improved food utilization can be achieved through a deliberate effort to integrate nutrition in all agriculture devel-opment programs. Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) supports households and communities to increase access to and consumption of diversified foods from their own production or purchase throughout the year. In addition, the Ministry plays an important role in reducing post-harvest losses and addressing issues related to women\u2019s workload within households. All this is aimed at improving nutrition among house - holds and communities and is in line with the Uganda Nutrition Action Plan (UNAP 2011\u20132016). However, malnutrition remains one of the main health and economic problems facing our country and has negative consequences on produc - tivity. The productivity lost when agriculture workers take time off to deal with malnutrition related illnesses or deaths in their families is enor - mous. For example, the loss caused by iron deficiency anaemia in adults alone is US$34 million worth of productivity (PROFILES, 2012).",

Keys considerations Quality of farming inputs: Encourage farmer group to plan for diver - sified inputs which are nutrient rich including fruits and vegetables; biofortified foods; animal source products. Ensure Male and f emale in volvement in participa tory planning (f armer group discussions): In Uganda women provide the majority of the labour force in agriculture and are basically the caregivers in homes including all aspects of child feeding and home management. Therefore they need deliberate targeting to increase farm productivity and adaption of posi - tive childcare practices. However, they also need support of their male counterparts to ensure home harmony and sustained change. Involvement of the most vulnerable farming households: Traditional extension had ignored these categories because they don\u2019t easily adapt the technologies being promoted. This further increases their vulnera- bility to malnutrition. They need consideration and deliberate targeting. Labour saving technologies: Provision of agriculture labour has a direct effect on childcare practices within the agricultural households.",

They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: \u2022 Carbohydrates \u2022 Proteins \u2022 Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 \u20133000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories.

There is a difference between gender and sex. Sex describes the biological and physiological differences between men and women while gender is a broader term defining cultural or social roles and expectations attached to men and women. Such roles and expectations vary from society to society and from time to time and impact on agricultural production and nutrition. Manifestation of gender expectations and roles in agricultural processes Sociocultural attitudes and perceptions influence how women and men perceive themselves and their roles in society consequently influence agriculture and nutrition outcomes. For example: women are respon - sible for the bulk of food production but continue not to participate in most agricultural projects due to limited powers in influencing decisions that are taken at various levels. \u2022 Yet few women own and control land but the majority can access it through their husbands or male relatives and thus utilize it accord- ing to specific instructions. Such instructions may not necessarily guarantee food security and nutrition. \u2022 Few women determine what enterprises to be done on the land \u2022 Men decide cash crop enterprises while women may decide food crop enterprises. \u2022 Food crop enterprises are restricted to small plots leaving the bigger portions for cash crops.",

    "chunk": "Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers28CHAPTER THREE MEAL PLANNING Meal planning is a process of determining, selecting and preparing foods to ensure a balanced diet for target groups or individ - uals. People will always want to eat food that is acceptable, therefore knowing the consumers\u2019 characteristics, food preferences and location is important in proper meal planning. Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body. Variety means including different foods from different food groups and within each food group, for example consuming cereals, root tubers (sweet potatoes, cassava), meat, vegetables and variety of fruits.",

There is a difference between gender and sex. Sex describes the biological and physiological differences between men and women while gender is a broader term defining cultural or social roles and expectations attached to men and women. Such roles and expectations vary from society to society and from time to time and impact on agricultural production and nutrition. Manifestation of gender expectations and roles in agricultural processes Sociocultural attitudes and perceptions influence how women and men perceive themselves and their roles in society consequently influence agriculture and nutrition outcomes. For example: women are respon - sible for the bulk of food production but continue not to participate in most agricultural projects due to limited powers in influencing decisions that are taken at various levels. \u2022 Yet few women own and control land but the majority can access it through their husbands or male relatives and thus utilize it accord- ing to specific instructions.

Uganda Nutrition Advocacy Messages (PROFILES) The productivity lost when agriculture workers take time off to deal with malnutrition-related illnesses or deaths in their families. The country losses about US$34 million worth of productivity because of iron defi-ciency anaemia among adults. Women of reproductive age with anaemia accounted for 75 percent, or US$25 million, of that loss. The total loss estimated at about 0.4 percent of the gross domestic product/GDP . Stunting in early childhood affects productivity in adulthood. For every 1 percent that the height of a child under 2 years of age is below the norm, the child\u2019s productivity from manual labour as an adult declines by 1.4 percent. Uganda losses about US$210 million worth of productivity from childhood stunting. These two conditions alone (iron deficiency anaemia and stunting) are associated with productivity loss of about US$290 million per year (PROFILES, 2009).

Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body.

Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 \u20133000 kilocalories (kcal).

Mothers are advised to breastfeed their babies as many times as the baby demands to be fed (at least 8 times a day, every 2\u20133 hours). This will help maintain milk production. Even when the child is ill, continue breast feeding.",

Women of reproductive age with anaemia accounted for 75 percent, or US$25 million, of that loss. The total loss estimated at about 0.4 percent of the gross domestic product/GDP . Stunting in early childhood affects productivity in adulthood. For every 1 percent that the height of a child under 2 years of age is below the norm, the child\u2019s productivity from manual labour as an adult declines by 1.4 percent. Uganda losses about US$210 million worth of productivity from childhood stunting.

They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: \u2022 Carbohydrates \u2022 Proteins \u2022 Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 \u20133000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories.

Malnutrition is a condition that develops when the body does not get the right amount of the nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function. It includes conditions, such as undernutrition, overnu-trition and micronutrient deficiency diseases (like vitamin A deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia, iodine deficiency disorders and zinc deficiency). Malnutrition affects MOSTLY people of the following categories: \u2022 Infants and children from pregnancy to two (2) years of age \u2022 Non-breastfed children \u2022 Pregnant and lactating women \u2022 People suffering from chronic or infectious disease \u2022 People are food insecure Types of malnutrition a) Undernutrition This is a nutrition a deficiency resulting from inadequate intake of food or inability of the body to convert or absorb food.

Therefore they need deliberate targeting to increase farm productivity and adaption of posi - tive childcare practices. However, they also need support of their male counterparts to ensure home harmony and sustained change. Involvement of the most vulnerable farming households: Traditional extension had ignored these categories because they don\u2019t easily adapt the technologies being promoted. This further increases their vulnera- bility to malnutrition. They need consideration and deliberate targeting. Labour saving technologies: Provision of agriculture labour has a direct effect on childcare practices within the agricultural households.",

Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: \u2022 Carbohydrates \u2022 Proteins \u2022 Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 \u20133000 kilocalories (kcal).

FOOD What is food? Food is anything liquid, semi-solid or solid which contains nutrients and energy and when taken or eaten nourishes the body. Food contains important substances which provide energy to move, think, work, run our body systems, keep us healthy, help to boost our immune system and protect us from infections. When we eat or take food, our bodies absorb useful nutrients into the blood and they are transported to areas where they are needed or stored. The food we eat or take is used for growth, maintenance and body functions. Classification of foods according to their functions Foods may be classified according to their functions in the body: a) Energy-giving foods (\u201cGO\u201d foods) Foods rich in carbohydrates and fats are called energy-giving foods or \u201cGO\u201d foods. They provide energy to the body and are essential for phys-ical activity and basic functioning of the body. Foods like cereals, roots, tubers, starchy fruits and vegetables oils, milk, butter and ghee are good sources of energy.",

Women of reproductive age with anaemia accounted for 75 percent, or US$25 million, of that loss. The total loss estimated at about 0.4 percent of the gross domestic product/GDP . Stunting in early childhood affects productivity in adulthood. For every 1 percent that the height of a child under 2 years of age is below the norm, the child\u2019s productivity from manual labour as an adult declines by 1.4 percent. Uganda losses about US$210 million worth of productivity from childhood stunting.

    "chunk": "Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workersii Foreword The overall objective of the National Agriculture Policy is to achieve food and nutrition security and improve household income. Food and nutrition security encompasses issues of food availability, access and utilization for maximum health benefits and social economic develop - ment. This can be achieved through enhanced agricultural productivity, proper farm management, agro-processing, marketing, community awareness, enhanced community and household capacity to withstand shocks and adapting appropriate practices that ensure better food utili - zation, for instance proper home care, personal hygiene, food prepara-tion and feeding practices. Improved food utilization can be achieved through a deliberate effort to integrate nutrition in all agriculture devel-opment programs. Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) supports households and communities to increase access to and consumption of diversified foods from their own production or purchase throughout the year. In addition, the Ministry plays an important role in reducing post-harvest losses and addressing issues related to women\u2019s workload within households. All this is aimed at improving nutrition among house - holds and communities and is in line with the Uganda Nutrition Action Plan (UNAP 2011\u20132016). However, malnutrition remains one of the main health and economic problems facing our country and has negative consequences on produc - tivity. The productivity lost when agriculture workers take time off to deal with malnutrition related illnesses or deaths in their families is enor - mous. For example, the loss caused by iron deficiency anaemia in adults alone is US$34 million worth of productivity (PROFILES, 2012).",

This form of malnutrition cannot be identi- fied easily except in advanced stages when clinical signs appear. Minerals and vitamins are required by the body in very small quantities, they are very important in protecting the body against infections. Usually, their absence in the diet does not cause a person to \u201cfeel hungry.\u201d Micronutrient deficiency disorders of public health significance in Uganda are: \u2022 Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) \u2022 Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) \u2022 Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) \u2022 Zinc deficiency disorder (ZDD) c) Overnutrition This is the excessive intake of nutrients in foods over a given period of time exposing individuals to poor health. Overnutrition results in over - weight, obesity, or vitamin toxicity. Overnutrition may be caused by any of the following factors: \u2022 Eating habits (overeating) \u2022 Health conditions \u2022 Taking too many unprescribed dietary supplements \u2022 Lack of physical activity (sedentary lifestyle) \u2022 Psychological factors (stress) \u2022 Environmental factors (unsafe foods, e.g., heavy metals in food, peer pressure) \u2022 Medication \u2022 Genetic factors",

There is a difference between gender and sex. Sex describes the biological and physiological differences between men and women while gender is a broader term defining cultural or social roles and expectations attached to men and women. Such roles and expectations vary from society to society and from time to time and impact on agricultural production and nutrition. Manifestation of gender expectations and roles in agricultural processes Sociocultural attitudes and perceptions influence how women and men perceive themselves and their roles in society consequently influence agriculture and nutrition outcomes. For example: women are respon - sible for the bulk of food production but continue not to participate in most agricultural projects due to limited powers in influencing decisions that are taken at various levels. \u2022 Yet few women own and control land but the majority can access it through their husbands or male relatives and thus utilize it accord- ing to specific instructions. Such instructions may not necessarily guarantee food security and nutrition. \u2022 Few women determine what enterprises to be done on the land \u2022 Men decide cash crop enterprises while women may decide food crop enterprises. \u2022 Food crop enterprises are restricted to small plots leaving the bigger portions for cash crops.",

Street foods, food vending, restau-rants and hotels have become quite common of recent. Food becomes unsafe for human consumption when the concentrations of the following (referred to as hazards) are above tolerance levels: \u2022 Microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses), parasites \u2022 Biological toxins such as mycotoxins \u2022 Physical materials like metal chips, sand, faecal material, stones \u2022 Chemical residues including heavy metals such as lead, mercury, copper and others Microorganisms including (bacteria, fungi, viruses) are the leading cause of food poisoning in the world.

There is also growing evidence that aflatoxins and mycotoxins in general can lead to reduced immunity and other associated effects such as incidence of HIV/AIDS and undernutrition. It is also linked to negative outcomes in animal growth and reproduction. Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: \u2022 Children: 30 \u201350 g (half a palm of meat) \u2022 Teenagers: 60 \u201375 g (a palm of meat) \u2022 Adults: 60 \u201370 g (a palm of meat) \u2022 Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel).

WASH practices benefit everyone, and integrating these prac- tices into nutrition care programs provides additional opportunities and resources to improve overall health outcomes. Water access \u2022 Access to safe water is considered a basic human need and, in most countries, a basic human right. \u2022 For many people especially in rural communities, there is lack ac-cess to safe water. \u2022 The negative effects of lack of access to sufficient quantities of water, water of reasonable quality, basic sanitation and hygiene are magnified for sick people including the malnourished clients. \u2022 The added burden of unsafe water affects not only the malnour - ished individual, but the entire family, increasing the risk of diar - rhoea disease and lost productivity.

People will always want to eat food that is acceptable, therefore knowing the consumers\u2019 characteristics, food preferences and location is important in proper meal planning. Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body.

FOOD What is food? Food is anything liquid, semi-solid or solid which contains nutrients and energy and when taken or eaten nourishes the body. Food contains important substances which provide energy to move, think, work, run our body systems, keep us healthy, help to boost our immune system and protect us from infections. When we eat or take food, our bodies absorb useful nutrients into the blood and they are transported to areas where they are needed or stored. The food we eat or take is used for growth, maintenance and body functions. Classification of foods according to their functions Foods may be classified according to their functions in the body: a) Energy-giving foods (\u201cGO\u201d foods) Foods rich in carbohydrates and fats are called energy-giving foods or \u201cGO\u201d foods. They provide energy to the body and are essential for phys-ical activity and basic functioning of the body.

Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body.

Breast milk is the best food for babies and is all the baby needs up to six months of age. Children from birth to six months of age should be exclusively breastfed. If you introduce any food before six months you will poten-tially expose the baby to unsafe and poor quality meals. Exclusive breastfeeding refers to feeding a child on breast milk only for the first six months.

Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD), is the single most common cause of preventable mental impairment, brain damage, and physical disabili - ties among children in Uganda. Women with IDDs give birth to children with reduced ability to learn, lower school performance, higher rates of school-age repetition, and poor speech and hearing ability. What is especially tragic is that the effects of iodine deficiency are permanent.

People will always want to eat food that is acceptable, therefore knowing the consumers\u2019 characteristics, food preferences and location is important in proper meal planning. Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body.

When we eat or take food, our bodies absorb useful nutrients into the blood and they are transported to areas where they are needed or stored. The food we eat or take is used for growth, maintenance and body functions. Classification of foods according to their functions Foods may be classified according to their functions in the body: a) Energy-giving foods (\u201cGO\u201d foods) Foods rich in carbohydrates and fats are called energy-giving foods or \u201cGO\u201d foods. They provide energy to the body and are essential for phys-ical activity and basic functioning of the body. Foods like cereals, roots, tubers, starchy fruits and vegetables oils, milk, butter and ghee are good sources of energy.",

    "question": "Can the diet for a pregnant woman be the same as a breastfeeding mother's diet?",
    "chunk": "Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers35Nutrition for breastfeeding mothers Nutritional requirements during breastfeeding are higher than during pregnancy because the mother has to produce enough milk to sustain a baby (bigger than the foetus) for the first six months and beyond. Breast - feeding women need to eat a wide variety of foods. Nutrition guidelines for pregnant women as well apply here but a lactating mother needs to eat much more; that is to say one extra meal (five meals in total). Breastfeeding mothers should also take a lot of fluids to cater for the high amounts of water used to make breast milk. They should avoid self-medication, smoking and alcohol to prevent intoxicating the baby. Breastfeeding mothers should avoid stress and have enough rest.KEY MESSAGES \u2022 Ensure that a pregnant mother has a balanced diet, with a vari- ety of foods from the food groups, and has one additional meal in addition to the 3 meals she receives daily. The fourth meal caters to her physiological needs. \u2022 Pregnant women should take iron and folate tablets daily in addition to foods rich in iron, calcium and vitamin A.

Food and nutrition security encompasses issues of food availability, access and utilization for maximum health benefits and social economic develop - ment. This can be achieved through enhanced agricultural productivity, proper farm management, agro-processing, marketing, community awareness, enhanced community and household capacity to withstand shocks and adapting appropriate practices that ensure better food utili - zation, for instance proper home care, personal hygiene, food prepara-tion and feeding practices. Improved food utilization can be achieved through a deliberate effort to integrate nutrition in all agriculture devel-opment programs. Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) supports households and communities to increase access to and consumption of diversified foods from their own production or purchase throughout the year. In addition, the Ministry plays an important role in reducing post-harvest losses and addressing issues related to women\u2019s workload within households. All this is aimed at improving nutrition among house - holds and communities and is in line with the Uganda Nutrition Action Plan (UNAP 2011\u20132016). However, malnutrition remains one of the main health and economic problems facing our country and has negative consequences on produc - tivity. The productivity lost when agriculture workers take time off to deal with malnutrition related illnesses or deaths in their families is enor - mous. For example, the loss caused by iron deficiency anaemia in adults alone is US$34 million worth of productivity (PROFILES, 2012).",

Improved food utilization can be achieved through a deliberate effort to integrate nutrition in all agriculture devel-opment programs.

    "chunk": "Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workersii Foreword The overall objective of the National Agriculture Policy is to achieve food and nutrition security and improve household income. Food and nutrition security encompasses issues of food availability, access and utilization for maximum health benefits and social economic develop - ment. This can be achieved through enhanced agricultural productivity, proper farm management, agro-processing, marketing, community awareness, enhanced community and household capacity to withstand shocks and adapting appropriate practices that ensure better food utili - zation, for instance proper home care, personal hygiene, food prepara-tion and feeding practices. Improved food utilization can be achieved through a deliberate effort to integrate nutrition in all agriculture devel-opment programs. Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) supports households and communities to increase access to and consumption of diversified foods from their own production or purchase throughout the year. In addition, the Ministry plays an important role in reducing post-harvest losses and addressing issues related to women\u2019s workload within households. All this is aimed at improving nutrition among house - holds and communities and is in line with the Uganda Nutrition Action Plan (UNAP 2011\u20132016). However, malnutrition remains one of the main health and economic problems facing our country and has negative consequences on produc - tivity. The productivity lost when agriculture workers take time off to deal with malnutrition related illnesses or deaths in their families is enor - mous. For example, the loss caused by iron deficiency anaemia in adults alone is US$34 million worth of productivity (PROFILES, 2012).",

    "chunk": "Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers28CHAPTER THREE MEAL PLANNING Meal planning is a process of determining, selecting and preparing foods to ensure a balanced diet for target groups or individ - uals. People will always want to eat food that is acceptable, therefore knowing the consumers\u2019 characteristics, food preferences and location is important in proper meal planning. Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body. Variety means including different foods from different food groups and within each food group, for example consuming cereals, root tubers (sweet potatoes, cassava), meat, vegetables and variety of fruits.",

Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD), is the single most common cause of preventable mental impairment, brain damage, and physical disabili - ties among children in Uganda. Women with IDDs give birth to children with reduced ability to learn, lower school performance, higher rates of school-age repetition, and poor speech and hearing ability.

    "chunk": "They are essential for promoting body immunity and regulate functions. Food Food is anything liquid, semi-solid or solid which contains nutrients and when taken or eaten nourishes the body. Food safety The protection of consumers from injury or adverse health effects caused by consuming or handling spoilt, adulterated or badly stored foods. Food safety describes the production, handling, preparation and storage of food in a way that prevents foodborne illnesses. This includes a number of routine activities that should be followed to avoid potentially severe health hazards. Food security Exists when all people at all times have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active, healthy and productive life throughout the year.",

However, for those with a lot of money it is important to note that too much feeding on red fatty meat (meat from animals with four legs and hoofs, e.g., beef, goat, pork, and sheep) and eggs can also be dangerous. It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body. Feed on some little animal protein in particular milk which is also rich in protective nutrients, if you are getting most of your protein supply from plants. This lowers the cost of feeding but maintains the quality.",

Potential hazards associated with food in Uganda Microbial pathogens for example: salmonella, campylobacter and esch- erichia coliare are associated with Diarrhoea diseases. Zoonotic diseases transmitted from animals to humans through food products, for example tuberculosis and brucellosis.",

Reten- tion of physical and nutritional qualities of agricultural produce can be ensured by developing appropriate and improved postharvest handling, storage and cooking. This keeps consumers healthier and improves the marketability of farm produce. Promote harvesting at the correct maturity stage \u2022 Harvest food at the right stage of maturity to ensure maximum nutrient availability, e.g., most fruits and vegetables have greater vitamin content if they are picked ripe from the plant, rather than being picked before they have fully ripened. \u2022 Over ripening of fruits will reduce the nutritional quality of fruits. \u2022 Avoid physical and mechanical damages during harvesting to ensure longer storage and safe food following the harvest. \u2022 Early planting prevents nuts from maturing during periods of low rainfall, which stresses a plant and encourages growth of the fungus on ripening crops. Cleaning \u2022 Drying of produce should be done on a clean and dry surface to avoid moisture and reduce the risk of contamination.

Immediate causes include: \u2022 Inadequate dietary intake including poor quality and quantity of food in the diet (poor dietary diversity). \u2022 Infection and diseases such as malaria, diarrhoeal diseases, acute respiratory infections, measles and worm infestations. \u2022 Low intake of foods rich in appropriate nutrients. \u2022 Low intake of substances like vitamin C that enhance nutrient ab-sorption. \u2022 High intake of factors like phytates and tannins that inhibit nutrient absorption. \u2022 Food insecurity. Underlying causes include: \u2022 Household food insecurity including poor access to a diverse diet, inadequate quantity of food available and accessible, and seasonal fluctuations in food availability. \u2022 Inadequate maternal and childcare, including suboptimal maternal nutrition and infant feeding practices, often a result of heavy work - loads for women and frequent births.",

Malnutrition is a condition that develops when the body does not get the right amount of the nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function. It includes conditions, such as undernutrition, overnu-trition and micronutrient deficiency diseases (like vitamin A deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia, iodine deficiency disorders and zinc deficiency).

Nutrition and agricultur e in formation sharing: During planning ensure that farmer groups provide a forum to discuss nutrition issues; groups can set rules ensuring all members practice essential nutrition actions (refer to chapter 3). Groups can buy labour saving technologies to address the issues of labour and child care; and empower farmers to demand for appropriate nutrition advice and information. Extension workers should train farmers to identify and articulate their nutrition needs. Selection of en terprise mix es tha t ha ve a high nutritio n impact: There is a tendency to focus of high yielding and profitable products in farming as a business. The prioritization and allocation of enterprises (zoning) across Uganda has emphasized food availability and commercialization with minimal emphasis on nutrition security. Extension workers should encourage and ensure farmers\u2019 enterprise selection provides for both nutrition and income generation benefits.

FOOD What is food? Food is anything liquid, semi-solid or solid which contains nutrients and energy and when taken or eaten nourishes the body. Food contains important substances which provide energy to move, think, work, run our body systems, keep us healthy, help to boost our immune system and protect us from infections. When we eat or take food, our bodies absorb useful nutrients into the blood and they are transported to areas where they are needed or stored. The food we eat or take is used for growth, maintenance and body functions. Classification of foods according to their functions Foods may be classified according to their functions in the body: a) Energy-giving foods (\u201cGO\u201d foods) Foods rich in carbohydrates and fats are called energy-giving foods or \u201cGO\u201d foods. They provide energy to the body and are essential for phys-ical activity and basic functioning of the body. Foods like cereals, roots, tubers, starchy fruits and vegetables oils, milk, butter and ghee are good sources of energy.",

Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.

    "chunk": "Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workersii Foreword The overall objective of the National Agriculture Policy is to achieve food and nutrition security and improve household income. Food and nutrition security encompasses issues of food availability, access and utilization for maximum health benefits and social economic develop - ment. This can be achieved through enhanced agricultural productivity, proper farm management, agro-processing, marketing, community awareness, enhanced community and household capacity to withstand shocks and adapting appropriate practices that ensure better food utili - zation, for instance proper home care, personal hygiene, food prepara-tion and feeding practices. Improved food utilization can be achieved through a deliberate effort to integrate nutrition in all agriculture devel-opment programs. Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) supports households and communities to increase access to and consumption of diversified foods from their own production or purchase throughout the year. In addition, the Ministry plays an important role in reducing post-harvest losses and addressing issues related to women\u2019s workload within households. All this is aimed at improving nutrition among house - holds and communities and is in line with the Uganda Nutrition Action Plan (UNAP 2011\u20132016). However, malnutrition remains one of the main health and economic problems facing our country and has negative consequences on produc - tivity. The productivity lost when agriculture workers take time off to deal with malnutrition related illnesses or deaths in their families is enor - mous. For example, the loss caused by iron deficiency anaemia in adults alone is US$34 million worth of productivity (PROFILES, 2012).",

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: \u2022 Children: 30 \u201350 g (half a palm of meat) \u2022 Teenagers: 60 \u201375 g (a palm of meat) \u2022 Adults: 60 \u201370 g (a palm of meat) \u2022 Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature.",

    "chunk": "Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workersii Foreword The overall objective of the National Agriculture Policy is to achieve food and nutrition security and improve household income. Food and nutrition security encompasses issues of food availability, access and utilization for maximum health benefits and social economic develop - ment. This can be achieved through enhanced agricultural productivity, proper farm management, agro-processing, marketing, community awareness, enhanced community and household capacity to withstand shocks and adapting appropriate practices that ensure better food utili - zation, for instance proper home care, personal hygiene, food prepara-tion and feeding practices. Improved food utilization can be achieved through a deliberate effort to integrate nutrition in all agriculture devel-opment programs. Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) supports households and communities to increase access to and consumption of diversified foods from their own production or purchase throughout the year. In addition, the Ministry plays an important role in reducing post-harvest losses and addressing issues related to women\u2019s workload within households. All this is aimed at improving nutrition among house - holds and communities and is in line with the Uganda Nutrition Action Plan (UNAP 2011\u20132016). However, malnutrition remains one of the main health and economic problems facing our country and has negative consequences on produc - tivity. The productivity lost when agriculture workers take time off to deal with malnutrition related illnesses or deaths in their families is enor - mous. For example, the loss caused by iron deficiency anaemia in adults alone is US$34 million worth of productivity (PROFILES, 2012).",

Food contains important substances which provide energy to move, think, work, run our body systems, keep us healthy, help to boost our immune system and protect us from infections. When we eat or take food, our bodies absorb useful nutrients into the blood and they are transported to areas where they are needed or stored. The food we eat or take is used for growth, maintenance and body functions. Classification of foods according to their functions Foods may be classified according to their functions in the body: a) Energy-giving foods (\u201cGO\u201d foods) Foods rich in carbohydrates and fats are called energy-giving foods or \u201cGO\u201d foods.

    "chunk": "Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers5Nutrients in food Nutrients are substances contained in food that nourish the body. They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: \u2022 Carbohydrates \u2022 Proteins \u2022 Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 \u20133000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.",

Food and nutrition security encompasses issues of food availability, access and utilization for maximum health benefits and social economic develop - ment. This can be achieved through enhanced agricultural productivity, proper farm management, agro-processing, marketing, community awareness, enhanced community and household capacity to withstand shocks and adapting appropriate practices that ensure better food utili - zation, for instance proper home care, personal hygiene, food prepara-tion and feeding practices. Improved food utilization can be achieved through a deliberate effort to integrate nutrition in all agriculture devel-opment programs. Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) supports households and communities to increase access to and consumption of diversified foods from their own production or purchase throughout the year. In addition, the Ministry plays an important role in reducing post-harvest losses and addressing issues related to women\u2019s workload within households. All this is aimed at improving nutrition among house - holds and communities and is in line with the Uganda Nutrition Action Plan (UNAP 2011\u20132016). However, malnutrition remains one of the main health and economic problems facing our country and has negative consequences on produc - tivity. The productivity lost when agriculture workers take time off to deal with malnutrition related illnesses or deaths in their families is enor - mous.

It keeps safely for 2\u20133 days even in warm weather. It is therefore less likely to give a child diarrhoea than ordinary porridge. \u2022 It is thinner and easier for a baby to eat and digest than plain por - ridge. \u2022 The absorption of non-haem iron, zinc and some other minerals is increased. Suggestions for stopping the child from breast feeding Complete withdrawal of a child from breast milk should be a slow and gradual process.

Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts.

Children with vitamin A deficiency are 1.4 times more likely to die of these and other childhood illnesses than ones that are not deficient. Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD), is the single most common cause of preventable mental impairment, brain damage, and physical disabili - ties among children in Uganda. Women with IDDs give birth to children with reduced ability to learn, lower school performance, higher rates of school-age repetition, and poor speech and hearing ability. What is especially tragic is that the effects of iodine deficiency are permanent. Because of IDD, in the year 2009 alone, 2,100 children were born as cretins in Uganda and likely will require 100 percent care in their entire lives, 59,000 children were born with mild or moderate mental disabil - ities and Uganda lost US$8.6 million in productivity (Uganda Profiles 2012).",

    "chunk": "Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers51Nutrition-friendly agricultural practices can be divided into three broad areas: A) PLANNING FOR NUTRITION FRIENDLY AGRICULTURE: NEEDS IDENTIFICATION The process of identification of farmer needs is the first entry point for integration of nutrition services. Farmers should be provided nutrition information and facilitated to articulate nutrition sensitive requirements during this process. Keys considerations Quality of farming inputs: Encourage farmer group to plan for diver - sified inputs which are nutrient rich including fruits and vegetables; biofortified foods; animal source products. Ensure Male and f emale in volvement in participa tory planning (f armer group discussions): In Uganda women provide the majority of the labour force in agriculture and are basically the caregivers in homes including all aspects of child feeding and home management. Therefore they need deliberate targeting to increase farm productivity and adaption of posi - tive childcare practices. However, they also need support of their male counterparts to ensure home harmony and sustained change. Involvement of the most vulnerable farming households: Traditional extension had ignored these categories because they don\u2019t easily adapt the technologies being promoted. This further increases their vulnera- bility to malnutrition. They need consideration and deliberate targeting. Labour saving technologies: Provision of agriculture labour has a direct effect on childcare practices within the agricultural households.",

Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults.

Malnutrition is a condition that develops when the body does not get the right amount of the nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function. It includes conditions, such as undernutrition, overnu-trition and micronutrient deficiency diseases (like vitamin A deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia, iodine deficiency disorders and zinc deficiency). Malnutrition affects MOSTLY people of the following categories: \u2022 Infants and children from pregnancy to two (2) years of age \u2022 Non-breastfed children \u2022 Pregnant and lactating women \u2022 People suffering from chronic or infectious disease \u2022 People are food insecure Types of malnutrition a) Undernutrition This is a nutrition a deficiency resulting from inadequate intake of food or inability of the body to convert or absorb food.

This form of malnutrition cannot be identi- fied easily except in advanced stages when clinical signs appear. Minerals and vitamins are required by the body in very small quantities, they are very important in protecting the body against infections. Usually, their absence in the diet does not cause a person to \u201cfeel hungry.\u201d Micronutrient deficiency disorders of public health significance in Uganda are: \u2022 Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) \u2022 Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) \u2022 Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) \u2022 Zinc deficiency disorder (ZDD) c) Overnutrition This is the excessive intake of nutrients in foods over a given period of time exposing individuals to poor health.

Keys considerations Quality of farming inputs: Encourage farmer group to plan for diver - sified inputs which are nutrient rich including fruits and vegetables; biofortified foods; animal source products. Ensure Male and f emale in volvement in participa tory planning (f armer group discussions): In Uganda women provide the majority of the labour force in agriculture and are basically the caregivers in homes including all aspects of child feeding and home management. Therefore they need deliberate targeting to increase farm productivity and adaption of posi - tive childcare practices. However, they also need support of their male counterparts to ensure home harmony and sustained change. Involvement of the most vulnerable farming households: Traditional extension had ignored these categories because they don\u2019t easily adapt the technologies being promoted. This further increases their vulnera- bility to malnutrition. They need consideration and deliberate targeting.

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: \u2022 Children: 30 \u201350 g (half a palm of meat) \u2022 Teenagers: 60 \u201375 g (a palm of meat) \u2022 Adults: 60 \u201370 g (a palm of meat) \u2022 Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel).

A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity. The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it. What is malnutrition? Malnutrition is a condition that develops when the body does not get the right amount of the nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function. It includes conditions, such as undernutrition, overnu-trition and micronutrient deficiency diseases (like vitamin A deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia, iodine deficiency disorders and zinc deficiency). Malnutrition affects MOSTLY people of the following categories: \u2022 Infants and children from pregnancy to two (2) years of age \u2022 Non-breastfed children \u2022 Pregnant and lactating women \u2022 People suffering from chronic or infectious disease \u2022 People are food insecure Types of malnutrition a) Undernutrition This is a nutrition a deficiency resulting from inadequate intake of food or inability of the body to convert or absorb food.

The majority of the market participants in the food industry are not aware of food safety issues and this is increas- ingly exposing the population to unsafe food consumption. \u2022 Current practices of food production, postharvest handling, process- ing, packaging, transportation, retailing and food preparation in the homes, street food vending and some restaurants may lead to food becoming unsafe for consumption. \u2022 Food safety related illnesses and problems such as cancer preva-lence are now a common occurrence in Uganda. \u2022 Much of this burden of illness results from basic sanitation failures that occur in food production, processing, storage, transportation, retailing and handling in the home or streets, restaurants and ho - tels. Potential hazards associated with food in Uganda Microbial pathogens for example: salmonella, campylobacter and esch- erichia coliare are associated with Diarrhoea diseases. Zoonotic diseases transmitted from animals to humans through food products, for example tuberculosis and brucellosis.",

These two conditions alone (iron deficiency anaemia and stunting) are associated with productivity loss of about US$290 million per year (PROFILES, 2009). Vitamin A deficiency, which affects mainly women and children in Uganda, increases the risk of blindness and susceptibility to diseases, mainly diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections in children. Children with vitamin A deficiency are 1.4 times more likely to die of these and other childhood illnesses than ones that are not deficient. Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD), is the single most common cause of preventable mental impairment, brain damage, and physical disabili - ties among children in Uganda. Women with IDDs give birth to children with reduced ability to learn, lower school performance, higher rates of school-age repetition, and poor speech and hearing ability. What is especially tragic is that the effects of iodine deficiency are permanent. Because of IDD, in the year 2009 alone, 2,100 children were born as cretins in Uganda and likely will require 100 percent care in their entire lives, 59,000 children were born with mild or moderate mental disabil - ities and Uganda lost US$8.6 million in productivity (Uganda Profiles 2012).",

Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body.

The majority of the market participants in the food industry are not aware of food safety issues and this is increas- ingly exposing the population to unsafe food consumption. \u2022 Current practices of food production, postharvest handling, process- ing, packaging, transportation, retailing and food preparation in the homes, street food vending and some restaurants may lead to food becoming unsafe for consumption. \u2022 Food safety related illnesses and problems such as cancer preva-lence are now a common occurrence in Uganda. \u2022 Much of this burden of illness results from basic sanitation failures that occur in food production, processing, storage, transportation, retailing and handling in the home or streets, restaurants and ho - tels. Potential hazards associated with food in Uganda Microbial pathogens for example: salmonella, campylobacter and esch- erichia coliare are associated with Diarrhoea diseases. Zoonotic diseases transmitted from animals to humans through food products, for example tuberculosis and brucellosis.",

Uganda Nutrition Advocacy Messages (PROFILES) The productivity lost when agriculture workers take time off to deal with malnutrition-related illnesses or deaths in their families. The country losses about US$34 million worth of productivity because of iron defi-ciency anaemia among adults. Women of reproductive age with anaemia accounted for 75 percent, or US$25 million, of that loss. The total loss estimated at about 0.4 percent of the gross domestic product/GDP . Stunting in early childhood affects productivity in adulthood. For every 1 percent that the height of a child under 2 years of age is below the norm, the child\u2019s productivity from manual labour as an adult declines by 1.4 percent. Uganda losses about US$210 million worth of productivity from childhood stunting. These two conditions alone (iron deficiency anaemia and stunting) are associated with productivity loss of about US$290 million per year (PROFILES, 2009). Vitamin A deficiency, which affects mainly women and children in Uganda, increases the risk of blindness and susceptibility to diseases, mainly diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections in children.",

Food becomes unsafe for human consumption when the concentrations of the following (referred to as hazards) are above tolerance levels: \u2022 Microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses), parasites \u2022 Biological toxins such as mycotoxins \u2022 Physical materials like metal chips, sand, faecal material, stones \u2022 Chemical residues including heavy metals such as lead, mercury, copper and others Microorganisms including (bacteria, fungi, viruses) are the leading cause of food poisoning in the world. Physical aspects of food items affected by microbial activity with potential toxin formation include the following: \u2022 Discoloration \u2022 Mouldy and other unpleasant tastes \u2022 Production of off odour Aflatoxins caused by the moulds of aspergillusspp are especially asso - ciated with occurrence of liver cancer in humans. There is also growing evidence that aflatoxins and mycotoxins in general can lead to reduced immunity and other associated effects such as incidence of HIV/AIDS and undernutrition. It is also linked to negative outcomes in animal growth and reproduction. Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.

Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body.

Uganda Nutrition Advocacy Messages (PROFILES) The productivity lost when agriculture workers take time off to deal with malnutrition-related illnesses or deaths in their families. The country losses about US$34 million worth of productivity because of iron defi-ciency anaemia among adults. Women of reproductive age with anaemia accounted for 75 percent, or US$25 million, of that loss. The total loss estimated at about 0.4 percent of the gross domestic product/GDP . Stunting in early childhood affects productivity in adulthood. For every 1 percent that the height of a child under 2 years of age is below the norm, the child\u2019s productivity from manual labour as an adult declines by 1.4 percent. Uganda losses about US$210 million worth of productivity from childhood stunting. These two conditions alone (iron deficiency anaemia and stunting) are associated with productivity loss of about US$290 million per year (PROFILES, 2009).

Food and nutrition security encompasses issues of food availability, access and utilization for maximum health benefits and social economic develop - ment. This can be achieved through enhanced agricultural productivity, proper farm management, agro-processing, marketing, community awareness, enhanced community and household capacity to withstand shocks and adapting appropriate practices that ensure better food utili - zation, for instance proper home care, personal hygiene, food prepara-tion and feeding practices. Improved food utilization can be achieved through a deliberate effort to integrate nutrition in all agriculture devel-opment programs. Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) supports households and communities to increase access to and consumption of diversified foods from their own production or purchase throughout the year. In addition, the Ministry plays an important role in reducing post-harvest losses and addressing issues related to women\u2019s workload within households. All this is aimed at improving nutrition among house - holds and communities and is in line with the Uganda Nutrition Action Plan (UNAP 2011\u20132016). However, malnutrition remains one of the main health and economic problems facing our country and has negative consequences on produc - tivity. The productivity lost when agriculture workers take time off to deal with malnutrition related illnesses or deaths in their families is enor - mous. For example, the loss caused by iron deficiency anaemia in adults alone is US$34 million worth of productivity (PROFILES, 2012).",

Food and nutrition security encompasses issues of food availability, access and utilization for maximum health benefits and social economic develop - ment. This can be achieved through enhanced agricultural productivity, proper farm management, agro-processing, marketing, community awareness, enhanced community and household capacity to withstand shocks and adapting appropriate practices that ensure better food utili - zation, for instance proper home care, personal hygiene, food prepara-tion and feeding practices. Improved food utilization can be achieved through a deliberate effort to integrate nutrition in all agriculture devel-opment programs. Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) supports households and communities to increase access to and consumption of diversified foods from their own production or purchase throughout the year. In addition, the Ministry plays an important role in reducing post-harvest losses and addressing issues related to women\u2019s workload within households. All this is aimed at improving nutrition among house - holds and communities and is in line with the Uganda Nutrition Action Plan (UNAP 2011\u20132016). However, malnutrition remains one of the main health and economic problems facing our country and has negative consequences on produc - tivity. The productivity lost when agriculture workers take time off to deal with malnutrition related illnesses or deaths in their families is enor - mous. For example, the loss caused by iron deficiency anaemia in adults alone is US$34 million worth of productivity (PROFILES, 2012).",

These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age. The young child gradually becomes accustomed to eating ordinary foods. Breastfeeding should continue until the child is 2 years old or even beyond because breast milk is an important source of nutrients and protective factors.

    "chunk": "Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workersii Foreword The overall objective of the National Agriculture Policy is to achieve food and nutrition security and improve household income. Food and nutrition security encompasses issues of food availability, access and utilization for maximum health benefits and social economic develop - ment. This can be achieved through enhanced agricultural productivity, proper farm management, agro-processing, marketing, community awareness, enhanced community and household capacity to withstand shocks and adapting appropriate practices that ensure better food utili - zation, for instance proper home care, personal hygiene, food prepara-tion and feeding practices. Improved food utilization can be achieved through a deliberate effort to integrate nutrition in all agriculture devel-opment programs. Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) supports households and communities to increase access to and consumption of diversified foods from their own production or purchase throughout the year. In addition, the Ministry plays an important role in reducing post-harvest losses and addressing issues related to women\u2019s workload within households. All this is aimed at improving nutrition among house - holds and communities and is in line with the Uganda Nutrition Action Plan (UNAP 2011\u20132016). However, malnutrition remains one of the main health and economic problems facing our country and has negative consequences on produc - tivity. The productivity lost when agriculture workers take time off to deal with malnutrition related illnesses or deaths in their families is enor - mous. For example, the loss caused by iron deficiency anaemia in adults alone is US$34 million worth of productivity (PROFILES, 2012).",

People will always want to eat food that is acceptable, therefore knowing the consumers\u2019 characteristics, food preferences and location is important in proper meal planning. Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body.

Importance of food safety in Uganda \u2022 As the country develops, an increasing percentage of the population is eating food prepared from outside the home or at least processed away from home. The majority of the market participants in the food industry are not aware of food safety issues and this is increas- ingly exposing the population to unsafe food consumption. \u2022 Current practices of food production, postharvest handling, process- ing, packaging, transportation, retailing and food preparation in the homes, street food vending and some restaurants may lead to food becoming unsafe for consumption. \u2022 Food safety related illnesses and problems such as cancer preva-lence are now a common occurrence in Uganda. \u2022 Much of this burden of illness results from basic sanitation failures that occur in food production, processing, storage, transportation, retailing and handling in the home or streets, restaurants and ho - tels. Potential hazards associated with food in Uganda Microbial pathogens for example: salmonella, campylobacter and esch- erichia coliare are associated with Diarrhoea diseases.

They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: \u2022 Carbohydrates \u2022 Proteins \u2022 Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 \u20133000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.",

WASH practices benefit everyone, and integrating these prac- tices into nutrition care programs provides additional opportunities and resources to improve overall health outcomes. Water access \u2022 Access to safe water is considered a basic human need and, in most countries, a basic human right. \u2022 For many people especially in rural communities, there is lack ac-cess to safe water. \u2022 The negative effects of lack of access to sufficient quantities of water, water of reasonable quality, basic sanitation and hygiene are magnified for sick people including the malnourished clients. \u2022 The added burden of unsafe water affects not only the malnour - ished individual, but the entire family, increasing the risk of diar - rhoea disease and lost productivity. Water quality \u2022 Piped water is available in some areas, but is often untreated or is contaminated between the source and the home. \u2022 Simple, low cost technologies for treating and safely storing water at the household level can greatly improve the microbial quality of water and can significantly reduce diarrhoea achieving outcomes comparable to those achieved by hand washing and safe handling and disposal of faeces. \u2022 Several technologies are viable for treating water in the home: chlo - rination; use of aqua safe and water guard, use of various types of filters; proper boiling.",

People will always want to eat food that is acceptable, therefore knowing the consumers\u2019 characteristics, food preferences and location is important in proper meal planning. Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body. Variety means including different foods from different food groups and within each food group, for example consuming cereals, root tubers (sweet potatoes, cassava), meat, vegetables and variety of fruits.",

People will always want to eat food that is acceptable, therefore knowing the consumers\u2019 characteristics, food preferences and location is important in proper meal planning. Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body.

    "chunk": "Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension WorkersviiiAflatoxin Aflatoxins are naturally occurring toxins (mycotoxins) produced by moulds in the food chain. These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age. The young child gradually becomes accustomed to eating ordinary foods. Breastfeeding should continue until the child is 2 years old or even beyond because breast milk is an important source of nutrients and protective factors. ENA Essential Nutrition Actions These are actions targeting different causes of malnutrition that a sector or a nation must undertake through appropriate interventions leading to rapid nutrition improvement at the household level, the community and the nation as a whole. DGLV Dark green leafy vegetables Dietary diversity Eating a diverse diet means eating many different foods each day that can enable an individual to achieve a balanced diet.

The ideal storage consists of dry, impermeable spaces kept at low temperature. If crops are kept on damp floors or in pits (even in bags) or humidity rises above 80 per - cent, the likelihood of Aspergillus growth and aflatoxin production is very high. \u2022 Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. \u2022 Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.

Reten- tion of physical and nutritional qualities of agricultural produce can be ensured by developing appropriate and improved postharvest handling, storage and cooking. This keeps consumers healthier and improves the marketability of farm produce. Promote harvesting at the correct maturity stage \u2022 Harvest food at the right stage of maturity to ensure maximum nutrient availability, e.g., most fruits and vegetables have greater vitamin content if they are picked ripe from the plant, rather than being picked before they have fully ripened. \u2022 Over ripening of fruits will reduce the nutritional quality of fruits. \u2022 Avoid physical and mechanical damages during harvesting to ensure longer storage and safe food following the harvest. \u2022 Early planting prevents nuts from maturing during periods of low rainfall, which stresses a plant and encourages growth of the fungus on ripening crops.

It can result in diseases such as high blood pressure, heart attack and to some extent diabetes. Fish is the best among these animal proteins, followed by poultry and to some extent rabbits. Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.

Ensure Male and f emale in volvement in participa tory planning (f armer group discussions): In Uganda women provide the majority of the labour force in agriculture and are basically the caregivers in homes including all aspects of child feeding and home management.

However, they also need support of their male counterparts to ensure home harmony and sustained change.

Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body.

These two conditions alone (iron deficiency anaemia and stunting) are associated with productivity loss of about US$290 million per year (PROFILES, 2009).

Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD), is the single most common cause of preventable mental impairment, brain damage, and physical disabili - ties among children in Uganda. Women with IDDs give birth to children with reduced ability to learn, lower school performance, higher rates of school-age repetition, and poor speech and hearing ability. What is especially tragic is that the effects of iodine deficiency are permanent.

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: \u2022 Children: 30 \u201350 g (half a palm of meat) \u2022 Teenagers: 60 \u201375 g (a palm of meat) \u2022 Adults: 60 \u201370 g (a palm of meat) \u2022 Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources.

A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity. The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it. What is malnutrition? Malnutrition is a condition that develops when the body does not get the right amount of the nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function. It includes conditions, such as undernutrition, overnu-trition and micronutrient deficiency diseases (like vitamin A deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia, iodine deficiency disorders and zinc deficiency). Malnutrition affects MOSTLY people of the following categories: \u2022 Infants and children from pregnancy to two (2) years of age \u2022 Non-breastfed children \u2022 Pregnant and lactating women \u2022 People suffering from chronic or infectious disease \u2022 People are food insecure Types of malnutrition a) Undernutrition This is a nutrition a deficiency resulting from inadequate intake of food or inability of the body to convert or absorb food.

    "question": "What the National Agriculture Policy is primarily intended to achieve?",
    "chunk": "Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workersii Foreword The overall objective of the National Agriculture Policy is to achieve food and nutrition security and improve household income. Food and nutrition security encompasses issues of food availability, access and utilization for maximum health benefits and social economic develop - ment. This can be achieved through enhanced agricultural productivity, proper farm management, agro-processing, marketing, community awareness, enhanced community and household capacity to withstand shocks and adapting appropriate practices that ensure better food utili - zation, for instance proper home care, personal hygiene, food prepara-tion and feeding practices. Improved food utilization can be achieved through a deliberate effort to integrate nutrition in all agriculture devel-opment programs. Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) supports households and communities to increase access to and consumption of diversified foods from their own production or purchase throughout the year. In addition, the Ministry plays an important role in reducing post-harvest losses and addressing issues related to women\u2019s workload within households. All this is aimed at improving nutrition among house - holds and communities and is in line with the Uganda Nutrition Action Plan (UNAP 2011\u20132016). However, malnutrition remains one of the main health and economic problems facing our country and has negative consequences on produc - tivity. The productivity lost when agriculture workers take time off to deal with malnutrition related illnesses or deaths in their families is enor - mous. For example, the loss caused by iron deficiency anaemia in adults alone is US$34 million worth of productivity (PROFILES, 2012).",

People will always want to eat food that is acceptable, therefore knowing the consumers\u2019 characteristics, food preferences and location is important in proper meal planning. Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body.

Women of reproductive age with anaemia accounted for 75 percent, or US$25 million, of that loss. The total loss estimated at about 0.4 percent of the gross domestic product/GDP . Stunting in early childhood affects productivity in adulthood. For every 1 percent that the height of a child under 2 years of age is below the norm, the child\u2019s productivity from manual labour as an adult declines by 1.4 percent. Uganda losses about US$210 million worth of productivity from childhood stunting.

However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: \u2022 Children: 30 \u201350 g (half a palm of meat) \u2022 Teenagers: 60 \u201375 g (a palm of meat) \u2022 Adults: 60 \u201370 g (a palm of meat) \u2022 Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel). Saturated fats increase the risk of heart disease. Those containing unsaturated fatty acids are liquid at room temperature.",

    "chunk": "Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers35Nutrition for breastfeeding mothers Nutritional requirements during breastfeeding are higher than during pregnancy because the mother has to produce enough milk to sustain a baby (bigger than the foetus) for the first six months and beyond. Breast - feeding women need to eat a wide variety of foods. Nutrition guidelines for pregnant women as well apply here but a lactating mother needs to eat much more; that is to say one extra meal (five meals in total). Breastfeeding mothers should also take a lot of fluids to cater for the high amounts of water used to make breast milk. They should avoid self-medication, smoking and alcohol to prevent intoxicating the baby. Breastfeeding mothers should avoid stress and have enough rest.KEY MESSAGES \u2022 Ensure that a pregnant mother has a balanced diet, with a vari- ety of foods from the food groups, and has one additional meal in addition to the 3 meals she receives daily.

There is also growing evidence that aflatoxins and mycotoxins in general can lead to reduced immunity and other associated effects such as incidence of HIV/AIDS and undernutrition. It is also linked to negative outcomes in animal growth and reproduction. Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.

Women of reproductive age with anaemia accounted for 75 percent, or US$25 million, of that loss. The total loss estimated at about 0.4 percent of the gross domestic product/GDP . Stunting in early childhood affects productivity in adulthood. For every 1 percent that the height of a child under 2 years of age is below the norm, the child\u2019s productivity from manual labour as an adult declines by 1.4 percent.

    "question": "Can you provide details on the financial outcomes of childhood stunting in Uganda?",
    "chunk": "Uganda losses about US$210 million worth of productivity from childhood stunting. These two conditions alone (iron deficiency anaemia and stunting) are associated with productivity loss of about US$290 million per year (PROFILES, 2009). Vitamin A deficiency, which affects mainly women and children in Uganda, increases the risk of blindness and susceptibility to diseases, mainly diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections in children. Children with vitamin A deficiency are 1.4 times more likely to die of these and other childhood illnesses than ones that are not deficient. Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD), is the single most common cause of preventable mental impairment, brain damage, and physical disabili - ties among children in Uganda. Women with IDDs give birth to children with reduced ability to learn, lower school performance, higher rates of school-age repetition, and poor speech and hearing ability. What is especially tragic is that the effects of iodine deficiency are permanent. Because of IDD, in the year 2009 alone, 2,100 children were born as cretins in Uganda and likely will require 100 percent care in their entire lives, 59,000 children were born with mild or moderate mental disabil - ities and Uganda lost US$8.6 million in productivity (Uganda Profiles 2012).",

People will always want to eat food that is acceptable, therefore knowing the consumers\u2019 characteristics, food preferences and location is important in proper meal planning. Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body. Variety means including different foods from different food groups and within each food group, for example consuming cereals, root tubers (sweet potatoes, cassava), meat, vegetables and variety of fruits.",

    "question": "How does gender relations affect marketing of agricultural produce?",
    "chunk": "Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers67E) NUTRITION CONSIDERATION IN AGRICULTURAL MARKETING Marketing is key to agricultural production because without it there is no financial return on investment in agriculture. Marketing stimulates and sustains production. It is understandable when farmers seek to get market for their produce because it makes business sense. However marketing should not compromise household food security and nutri - tion for the producer and consumer: \u2022 Marketing should consider nutrition of the end user/consumer and thus packaging should be done in dry and clean packs/materials/ containers. \u2022 For marketing to result in improved nutrition gender relations in the homes are very critical. \u2022 Both men and women should participate in marketing of farm produce, but because gender relations are still complicated women could be allowed to be in charge of marketing traditional \u2018low value\u2019 crops. \u2022 Women should also be allowed to have control and access of the incomes accrued from their participation in the marketing of foods. \u2022 It is highly likely that women will use the incomes they have got from food sales to buy other nutritious foods for the whole house - hold. \u2022 Income from the sale of farm produce can be spent on a number of priority areas but food and dietary needs should not be compro- mised.

Reten- tion of physical and nutritional qualities of agricultural produce can be ensured by developing appropriate and improved postharvest handling, storage and cooking. This keeps consumers healthier and improves the marketability of farm produce. Promote harvesting at the correct maturity stage \u2022 Harvest food at the right stage of maturity to ensure maximum nutrient availability, e.g., most fruits and vegetables have greater vitamin content if they are picked ripe from the plant, rather than being picked before they have fully ripened. \u2022 Over ripening of fruits will reduce the nutritional quality of fruits. \u2022 Avoid physical and mechanical damages during harvesting to ensure longer storage and safe food following the harvest. \u2022 Early planting prevents nuts from maturing during periods of low rainfall, which stresses a plant and encourages growth of the fungus on ripening crops. Cleaning \u2022 Drying of produce should be done on a clean and dry surface to avoid moisture and reduce the risk of contamination. As much as possible tarpaulins should be used. \u2022 It is recommended that drying is done on a raised platform, one (1) meter above the ground to reduce contamination from animals passing by.",

The ideal storage consists of dry, impermeable spaces kept at low temperature. If crops are kept on damp floors or in pits (even in bags) or humidity rises above 80 per - cent, the likelihood of Aspergillus growth and aflatoxin production is very high. \u2022 Integrated pre and postharvesting interventions should be put into consideration because aflatoxins are heat stable, even dry roast - ing does not remove aflatoxin contamination. Hand sorting at the household level may remove the worst (most mouldy) grain, seed contamination, but much of aflatoxin spoiled food is retained for consumption by households. \u2022 Adoption of best practices requires education at all levels including: social marketing, awareness creation in media, awareness cam- paigns on dangers and options at the household level, teaching at the farm and market levels (through extension and training), and promotion of risk minimization at industry processing (better under - standing of use of screening critical control points) and retail levels.

FOOD What is food? Food is anything liquid, semi-solid or solid which contains nutrients and energy and when taken or eaten nourishes the body. Food contains important substances which provide energy to move, think, work, run our body systems, keep us healthy, help to boost our immune system and protect us from infections. When we eat or take food, our bodies absorb useful nutrients into the blood and they are transported to areas where they are needed or stored. The food we eat or take is used for growth, maintenance and body functions. Classification of foods according to their functions Foods may be classified according to their functions in the body: a) Energy-giving foods (\u201cGO\u201d foods) Foods rich in carbohydrates and fats are called energy-giving foods or \u201cGO\u201d foods. They provide energy to the body and are essential for phys-ical activity and basic functioning of the body.

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: \u2022 Children: 30 \u201350 g (half a palm of meat) \u2022 Teenagers: 60 \u201375 g (a palm of meat) \u2022 Adults: 60 \u201370 g (a palm of meat) \u2022 Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel).
