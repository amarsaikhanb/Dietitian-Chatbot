    "chunk": "Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers48 Picture 15: Examples of proper hygiene practices. Washing hands after visiting toilet. A locally fabricated hand washing facility (tippy tap) should be strategi- cally positioned near the latrine for hand wash water and soap/ash after visiting the latrine. A clean, organized home environment prevents us from diseases, keeps us comfortable and adds beauty and scenic appeal to our homes. When diseases occur, they directly and negatively affect the nutritional status of a person no matter how well fed he/she was. It is possible to attain good standards of hygiene and sanitation regardless of where we live and under what conditions we live in. By maintaining a clean environ - ment through practicing proper sanitation and hygiene, we prevent many infections and therefore save on resources (money, energy and time for treatment). Prevention is better than cure: \u2022 Ensure good personal hygiene by regularly bathing, washing your clothes, trimming hair and nails. \u2022 The home surrounding should be kept clean by: \u2022 Sweeping the compound every day. \u2022 Keeping grass low.",

As much as possible tarpaulins should be used. \u2022 It is recommended that drying is done on a raised platform, one (1) meter above the ground to reduce contamination from animals passing by. Discourage processing practices that produce microbial contaminate of the agricultural harvest \u2022 Ensure crop is not left on the ground or on bare soil during drying, shelling and threshing, where fungal spores develop. The practice of moistening the unshelled nuts to make them easier to shell results in higher contamination from aflatoxin and should therefore be strictly discouraged.",

They are required by the body to maintain general health and physiological functions, for example: provision of energy, building the body mass, keeping the body warm, boosting immunity and regulating the various body functions that help someone to live. Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: \u2022 Carbohydrates \u2022 Proteins \u2022 Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 \u20133000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.",

    "chunk": "Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workersii Foreword The overall objective of the National Agriculture Policy is to achieve food and nutrition security and improve household income. Food and nutrition security encompasses issues of food availability, access and utilization for maximum health benefits and social economic develop - ment. This can be achieved through enhanced agricultural productivity, proper farm management, agro-processing, marketing, community awareness, enhanced community and household capacity to withstand shocks and adapting appropriate practices that ensure better food utili - zation, for instance proper home care, personal hygiene, food prepara-tion and feeding practices. Improved food utilization can be achieved through a deliberate effort to integrate nutrition in all agriculture devel-opment programs. Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) supports households and communities to increase access to and consumption of diversified foods from their own production or purchase throughout the year. In addition, the Ministry plays an important role in reducing post-harvest losses and addressing issues related to women\u2019s workload within households. All this is aimed at improving nutrition among house - holds and communities and is in line with the Uganda Nutrition Action Plan (UNAP 2011\u20132016). However, malnutrition remains one of the main health and economic problems facing our country and has negative consequences on produc - tivity. The productivity lost when agriculture workers take time off to deal with malnutrition related illnesses or deaths in their families is enor - mous. For example, the loss caused by iron deficiency anaemia in adults alone is US$34 million worth of productivity (PROFILES, 2012).",

Many people cannot afford animal protein. In that case they can use much of plant protein, e.g., soybeans, peas, cow peas, pigeon peas, common beans and ground nuts. Soy bean protein is exceptional in the plant group as it is almost equivalent to animal meats except it needs better processing in order to utilize it in the body.

FOOD What is food? Food is anything liquid, semi-solid or solid which contains nutrients and energy and when taken or eaten nourishes the body. Food contains important substances which provide energy to move, think, work, run our body systems, keep us healthy, help to boost our immune system and protect us from infections. When we eat or take food, our bodies absorb useful nutrients into the blood and they are transported to areas where they are needed or stored. The food we eat or take is used for growth, maintenance and body functions. Classification of foods according to their functions Foods may be classified according to their functions in the body: a) Energy-giving foods (\u201cGO\u201d foods) Foods rich in carbohydrates and fats are called energy-giving foods or \u201cGO\u201d foods. They provide energy to the body and are essential for phys-ical activity and basic functioning of the body. Foods like cereals, roots, tubers, starchy fruits and vegetables oils, milk, butter and ghee are good sources of energy.",

People will always want to eat food that is acceptable, therefore knowing the consumers\u2019 characteristics, food preferences and location is important in proper meal planning. Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body.

    "chunk": "Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers17CHAPTER TWO MALNUTRITION AND ITS PREVENTION This chapter defines malnutrition, its prevalence, consequences and possible agriculture based strategies to prevent or alleviate malnu - trition. A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity. The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it. What is malnutrition? Malnutrition is a condition that develops when the body does not get the right amount of the nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function. It includes conditions, such as undernutrition, overnu-trition and micronutrient deficiency diseases (like vitamin A deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia, iodine deficiency disorders and zinc deficiency). Malnutrition affects MOSTLY people of the following categories: \u2022 Infants and children from pregnancy to two (2) years of age \u2022 Non-breastfed children \u2022 Pregnant and lactating women \u2022 People suffering from chronic or infectious disease \u2022 People are food insecure Types of malnutrition a) Undernutrition This is a nutrition a deficiency resulting from inadequate intake of food or inability of the body to convert or absorb food. Undernutrition is the most common and easily observable type of malnutrition. Undernutrition often presents itself in two forms: acute and chronic.",

    "question": "What's the main aim of the National Agriculture Policy in terms of food and nutrition?",
    "chunk": "Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workersii Foreword The overall objective of the National Agriculture Policy is to achieve food and nutrition security and improve household income. Food and nutrition security encompasses issues of food availability, access and utilization for maximum health benefits and social economic develop - ment. This can be achieved through enhanced agricultural productivity, proper farm management, agro-processing, marketing, community awareness, enhanced community and household capacity to withstand shocks and adapting appropriate practices that ensure better food utili - zation, for instance proper home care, personal hygiene, food prepara-tion and feeding practices. Improved food utilization can be achieved through a deliberate effort to integrate nutrition in all agriculture devel-opment programs. Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) supports households and communities to increase access to and consumption of diversified foods from their own production or purchase throughout the year. In addition, the Ministry plays an important role in reducing post-harvest losses and addressing issues related to women\u2019s workload within households. All this is aimed at improving nutrition among house - holds and communities and is in line with the Uganda Nutrition Action Plan (UNAP 2011\u20132016). However, malnutrition remains one of the main health and economic problems facing our country and has negative consequences on produc - tivity. The productivity lost when agriculture workers take time off to deal with malnutrition related illnesses or deaths in their families is enor - mous. For example, the loss caused by iron deficiency anaemia in adults alone is US$34 million worth of productivity (PROFILES, 2012).",

WASH practices benefit everyone, and integrating these prac- tices into nutrition care programs provides additional opportunities and resources to improve overall health outcomes. Water access \u2022 Access to safe water is considered a basic human need and, in most countries, a basic human right. \u2022 For many people especially in rural communities, there is lack ac-cess to safe water. \u2022 The negative effects of lack of access to sufficient quantities of water, water of reasonable quality, basic sanitation and hygiene are magnified for sick people including the malnourished clients. \u2022 The added burden of unsafe water affects not only the malnour - ished individual, but the entire family, increasing the risk of diar - rhoea disease and lost productivity. Water quality \u2022 Piped water is available in some areas, but is often untreated or is contaminated between the source and the home. \u2022 Simple, low cost technologies for treating and safely storing water at the household level can greatly improve the microbial quality of water and can significantly reduce diarrhoea achieving outcomes comparable to those achieved by hand washing and safe handling and disposal of faeces. \u2022 Several technologies are viable for treating water in the home: chlo - rination; use of aqua safe and water guard, use of various types of filters; proper boiling.",

WASH practices benefit everyone, and integrating these prac- tices into nutrition care programs provides additional opportunities and resources to improve overall health outcomes. Water access \u2022 Access to safe water is considered a basic human need and, in most countries, a basic human right. \u2022 For many people especially in rural communities, there is lack ac-cess to safe water. \u2022 The negative effects of lack of access to sufficient quantities of water, water of reasonable quality, basic sanitation and hygiene are magnified for sick people including the malnourished clients. \u2022 The added burden of unsafe water affects not only the malnour - ished individual, but the entire family, increasing the risk of diar - rhoea disease and lost productivity. Water quality \u2022 Piped water is available in some areas, but is often untreated or is contaminated between the source and the home. \u2022 Simple, low cost technologies for treating and safely storing water at the household level can greatly improve the microbial quality of water and can significantly reduce diarrhoea achieving outcomes comparable to those achieved by hand washing and safe handling and disposal of faeces. \u2022 Several technologies are viable for treating water in the home: chlo - rination; use of aqua safe and water guard, use of various types of filters; proper boiling.",

A malnourished and sickly population has low agriculture productivity. The extension worker should demonstrate to community and households the gravity of the malnutrition situation and thus the need to prevent it. What is malnutrition? Malnutrition is a condition that develops when the body does not get the right amount of the nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function. It includes conditions, such as undernutrition, overnu-trition and micronutrient deficiency diseases (like vitamin A deficiency, iron deficiency anaemia, iodine deficiency disorders and zinc deficiency). Malnutrition affects MOSTLY people of the following categories: \u2022 Infants and children from pregnancy to two (2) years of age \u2022 Non-breastfed children \u2022 Pregnant and lactating women \u2022 People suffering from chronic or infectious disease \u2022 People are food insecure Types of malnutrition a) Undernutrition This is a nutrition a deficiency resulting from inadequate intake of food or inability of the body to convert or absorb food. Undernutrition is the most common and easily observable type of malnutrition. Undernutrition often presents itself in two forms: acute and chronic.",

Improved food utilization can be achieved through a deliberate effort to integrate nutrition in all agriculture devel-opment programs.

    "chunk": "Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workersii Foreword The overall objective of the National Agriculture Policy is to achieve food and nutrition security and improve household income. Food and nutrition security encompasses issues of food availability, access and utilization for maximum health benefits and social economic develop - ment. This can be achieved through enhanced agricultural productivity, proper farm management, agro-processing, marketing, community awareness, enhanced community and household capacity to withstand shocks and adapting appropriate practices that ensure better food utili - zation, for instance proper home care, personal hygiene, food prepara-tion and feeding practices. Improved food utilization can be achieved through a deliberate effort to integrate nutrition in all agriculture devel-opment programs. Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF) supports households and communities to increase access to and consumption of diversified foods from their own production or purchase throughout the year. In addition, the Ministry plays an important role in reducing post-harvest losses and addressing issues related to women\u2019s workload within households. All this is aimed at improving nutrition among house - holds and communities and is in line with the Uganda Nutrition Action Plan (UNAP 2011\u20132016). However, malnutrition remains one of the main health and economic problems facing our country and has negative consequences on produc - tivity. The productivity lost when agriculture workers take time off to deal with malnutrition related illnesses or deaths in their families is enor - mous. For example, the loss caused by iron deficiency anaemia in adults alone is US$34 million worth of productivity (PROFILES, 2012).",

Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children. Attaining a balanced diet requires that one: eats various food stuffs in a day, makes careful food choices from different food groups, and eats food in the right proportions and quality as required by the body.

    "question": "What's the economic toll of stunting and iron deficiency anemia in Uganda every year?",
    "chunk": "Uganda losses about US$210 million worth of productivity from childhood stunting. These two conditions alone (iron deficiency anaemia and stunting) are associated with productivity loss of about US$290 million per year (PROFILES, 2009). Vitamin A deficiency, which affects mainly women and children in Uganda, increases the risk of blindness and susceptibility to diseases, mainly diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections in children. Children with vitamin A deficiency are 1.4 times more likely to die of these and other childhood illnesses than ones that are not deficient. Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD), is the single most common cause of preventable mental impairment, brain damage, and physical disabili - ties among children in Uganda. Women with IDDs give birth to children with reduced ability to learn, lower school performance, higher rates of school-age repetition, and poor speech and hearing ability. What is especially tragic is that the effects of iodine deficiency are permanent. Because of IDD, in the year 2009 alone, 2,100 children were born as cretins in Uganda and likely will require 100 percent care in their entire lives, 59,000 children were born with mild or moderate mental disabil - ities and Uganda lost US$8.6 million in productivity (Uganda Profiles 2012).",

Therefore, consistent with these actions, the Ministry is concerned with nutrition for pregnant mothers, breastfeeding mothers and children below five years. Nutrition for pregnant women It is necessary that a woman is well nourished before pregnancy so that by the time she conceives, the body has sufficient capacity to meet both her and the baby\u2019s needs. A malnourished woman may fail to deliver baby alive or if she does, the baby is likely to be underweight (the normal range is 2.5\u20134.5 kg at birth). One of the leading causes of maternal death at childbirth is insufficient blood. During pregnancy women have high nutrient needs because they have to build foetus tissue, build reserves for breast milk and also cater for their own nutritional needs. On average women should gain 8 \u201312 kg in the course of pregnancy.

These toxins can cause cancers and liver damage in humans. Aflatoxin contamination can start in the field/ garden and continue throughout the food value chain. Control strategies will therefore involve appropriate pre and postharvest management practices. Complementary feedingThis refers to giving other foods in addition to breast milk at six (6) completed months of age. The young child gradually becomes accustomed to eating ordinary foods. Breastfeeding should continue until the child is 2 years old or even beyond because breast milk is an important source of nutrients and protective factors.

Common terms used in meal planning A meal is a selection of foods prepared and served in a single serving. The number of meals an individual eats in a day depends upon age, physiological status, health status, and physical activity level. Children eat small portions because their stomachs are small. However, they have increased nutrient requirements for growth and development and thus require more frequent feeding compared to adults. A balanced diet is a feeding pattern that provides adequate amounts of nutrients in their correct proportions as required by the body at a particular time. In order to obtain an adequate supply of nutrients human beings need at least three balanced meals a day in case of adults and at least five meals a day for children.

Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: \u2022 Carbohydrates \u2022 Proteins \u2022 Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 \u20133000 kilocalories (kcal).

FOOD What is food? Food is anything liquid, semi-solid or solid which contains nutrients and energy and when taken or eaten nourishes the body. Food contains important substances which provide energy to move, think, work, run our body systems, keep us healthy, help to boost our immune system and protect us from infections. When we eat or take food, our bodies absorb useful nutrients into the blood and they are transported to areas where they are needed or stored. The food we eat or take is used for growth, maintenance and body functions. Classification of foods according to their functions Foods may be classified according to their functions in the body: a) Energy-giving foods (\u201cGO\u201d foods) Foods rich in carbohydrates and fats are called energy-giving foods or \u201cGO\u201d foods. They provide energy to the body and are essential for phys-ical activity and basic functioning of the body. Foods like cereals, roots, tubers, starchy fruits and vegetables oils, milk, butter and ghee are good sources of energy.",

This form of malnutrition cannot be identi- fied easily except in advanced stages when clinical signs appear. Minerals and vitamins are required by the body in very small quantities, they are very important in protecting the body against infections. Usually, their absence in the diet does not cause a person to \u201cfeel hungry.\u201d Micronutrient deficiency disorders of public health significance in Uganda are: \u2022 Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) \u2022 Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) \u2022 Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) \u2022 Zinc deficiency disorder (ZDD) c) Overnutrition This is the excessive intake of nutrients in foods over a given period of time exposing individuals to poor health.

Nutrition for children 0 to 6 months Breastfeeding and complementary feeding behaviours are important predictors of infant and child nutrition, health and survival. Breast milk is the best food for babies and is all the baby needs up to six months of age. Children from birth to six months of age should be exclusively breastfed. If you introduce any food before six months you will poten-tially expose the baby to unsafe and poor quality meals. Exclusive breastfeeding refers to feeding a child on breast milk only for the first six months. Mothers are advised to breastfeed their babies as many times as the baby demands to be fed (at least 8 times a day, every 2\u20133 hours). This will help maintain milk production. Even when the child is ill, continue breast feeding.",

    "chunk": "Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers19b) Micronutrient malnutrition (lack of minerals and vitamins) This type of malnutrition is called \u201chidden hunger;\u201d and is due to inad - equate intake of dietary mineral salts and vitamins leading to vitamin mineral deficiencies (VMDs). This form of malnutrition cannot be identi- fied easily except in advanced stages when clinical signs appear. Minerals and vitamins are required by the body in very small quantities, they are very important in protecting the body against infections. Usually, their absence in the diet does not cause a person to \u201cfeel hungry.\u201d Micronutrient deficiency disorders of public health significance in Uganda are: \u2022 Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) \u2022 Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) \u2022 Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) \u2022 Zinc deficiency disorder (ZDD) c) Overnutrition This is the excessive intake of nutrients in foods over a given period of time exposing individuals to poor health. Overnutrition results in over - weight, obesity, or vitamin toxicity. Overnutrition may be caused by any of the following factors: \u2022 Eating habits (overeating) \u2022 Health conditions \u2022 Taking too many unprescribed dietary supplements \u2022 Lack of physical activity (sedentary lifestyle) \u2022 Psychological factors (stress) \u2022 Environmental factors (unsafe foods, e.g., heavy metals in food, peer pressure) \u2022 Medication \u2022 Genetic factors",

    "question": "Could you explain how much Uganda is losing due to childhood stunting?",
    "chunk": "Uganda losses about US$210 million worth of productivity from childhood stunting. These two conditions alone (iron deficiency anaemia and stunting) are associated with productivity loss of about US$290 million per year (PROFILES, 2009). Vitamin A deficiency, which affects mainly women and children in Uganda, increases the risk of blindness and susceptibility to diseases, mainly diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections in children. Children with vitamin A deficiency are 1.4 times more likely to die of these and other childhood illnesses than ones that are not deficient. Iodine deficiency disorder (IDD), is the single most common cause of preventable mental impairment, brain damage, and physical disabili - ties among children in Uganda. Women with IDDs give birth to children with reduced ability to learn, lower school performance, higher rates of school-age repetition, and poor speech and hearing ability. What is especially tragic is that the effects of iodine deficiency are permanent. Because of IDD, in the year 2009 alone, 2,100 children were born as cretins in Uganda and likely will require 100 percent care in their entire lives, 59,000 children were born with mild or moderate mental disabil - ities and Uganda lost US$8.6 million in productivity (Uganda Profiles 2012).",

Street foods, food vending, restau-rants and hotels have become quite common of recent. Food becomes unsafe for human consumption when the concentrations of the following (referred to as hazards) are above tolerance levels: \u2022 Microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses), parasites \u2022 Biological toxins such as mycotoxins \u2022 Physical materials like metal chips, sand, faecal material, stones \u2022 Chemical residues including heavy metals such as lead, mercury, copper and others Microorganisms including (bacteria, fungi, viruses) are the leading cause of food poisoning in the world. Physical aspects of food items affected by microbial activity with potential toxin formation include the following: \u2022 Discoloration \u2022 Mouldy and other unpleasant tastes \u2022 Production of off odour Aflatoxins caused by the moulds of aspergillusspp are especially asso - ciated with occurrence of liver cancer in humans. There is also growing evidence that aflatoxins and mycotoxins in general can lead to reduced immunity and other associated effects such as incidence of HIV/AIDS and undernutrition. It is also linked to negative outcomes in animal growth and reproduction. Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings. Food safety is the protection of consumers from injury or adverse health effects caused by consuming or handling spoilt, adul - terated or badly stored foods.",

Example: if a person is 60 kilograms, he will require 60 grams of protein each day. This is equivalent to one egg or a piece of meat about the size of an egg. However, children, teenagers, and preg - nant and lactating mothers require more protein as indicated below: \u2022 Children: 30 \u201350 g (half a palm of meat) \u2022 Teenagers: 60 \u201375 g (a palm of meat) \u2022 Adults: 60 \u201370 g (a palm of meat) \u2022 Pregnant and lactating mothers: 90 g (one and a half palm of meat) Fats and oils Fats and oils also known as lipids are derived from both animal and plant sources. Fats are rich in energy, build body cells, support brain development of infants, help body processes, and facilitate the absorption and use of fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The major component of lipids is glyc-erol and fatty acids. According to chemical properties, fatty acids can be divided into saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Generally lipids containing saturated fatty acids are solid at room temperature and include animal fats (butter, lard, tallow, ghee) and tropical oils (palm, coconut, palm kernel).

    "chunk": "Food and Nutrition Handbook for Extension Workers58utable to absence of adequate processing and preservation facilities among farming households; poor handling during loading and unloading at market points; bruising, puncturing, and crushing due to improper packing; absence of grading especially for fruits and vegetables and inadequate knowledge among farmers on cottage processing. Reten- tion of physical and nutritional qualities of agricultural produce can be ensured by developing appropriate and improved postharvest handling, storage and cooking. This keeps consumers healthier and improves the marketability of farm produce. Promote harvesting at the correct maturity stage \u2022 Harvest food at the right stage of maturity to ensure maximum nutrient availability, e.g., most fruits and vegetables have greater vitamin content if they are picked ripe from the plant, rather than being picked before they have fully ripened. \u2022 Over ripening of fruits will reduce the nutritional quality of fruits. \u2022 Avoid physical and mechanical damages during harvesting to ensure longer storage and safe food following the harvest. \u2022 Early planting prevents nuts from maturing during periods of low rainfall, which stresses a plant and encourages growth of the fungus on ripening crops. Cleaning \u2022 Drying of produce should be done on a clean and dry surface to avoid moisture and reduce the risk of contamination. As much as possible tarpaulins should be used. \u2022 It is recommended that drying is done on a raised platform, one (1) meter above the ground to reduce contamination from animals passing by.",

During weaning there are six princi - ples to follow: meal frequency, amount, thickness, variety, active feeding and hygiene. This is commonly referred to as the FATVAH. 1. Frequency of meals refers to the number of meals eaten in a day. In order to meet the child\u2019s body\u2019s needs, for growth, development, and activity, we must feed them frequent meals, meaning 3 meals and 2 snacks each day. 2.

Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: \u2022 Carbohydrates \u2022 Proteins \u2022 Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 \u20133000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.",

It keeps safely for 2\u20133 days even in warm weather. It is therefore less likely to give a child diarrhoea than ordinary porridge. \u2022 It is thinner and easier for a baby to eat and digest than plain por - ridge. \u2022 The absorption of non-haem iron, zinc and some other minerals is increased.

Food becomes unsafe for human consumption when the concentrations of the following (referred to as hazards) are above tolerance levels: \u2022 Microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses), parasites \u2022 Biological toxins such as mycotoxins \u2022 Physical materials like metal chips, sand, faecal material, stones \u2022 Chemical residues including heavy metals such as lead, mercury, copper and others Microorganisms including (bacteria, fungi, viruses) are the leading cause of food poisoning in the world. Physical aspects of food items affected by microbial activity with potential toxin formation include the following: \u2022 Discoloration \u2022 Mouldy and other unpleasant tastes \u2022 Production of off odour Aflatoxins caused by the moulds of aspergillusspp are especially asso - ciated with occurrence of liver cancer in humans. There is also growing evidence that aflatoxins and mycotoxins in general can lead to reduced immunity and other associated effects such as incidence of HIV/AIDS and undernutrition. It is also linked to negative outcomes in animal growth and reproduction. Aflatoxins are commonly found in human food and animal feeds in the humid conditions of the tropics. What is food safety? Food safety describes a process where food is free from hazardous contaminants and when eaten will not cause damage or disease to human beings.

Major nutrients in human nutrition Nutrients in food are divided into three major categories: macronutrients, micronutrients and water. 1) Macronutrients These are required in large amounts: \u2022 Carbohydrates \u2022 Proteins \u2022 Fats/oils Carbohydrates These are the primary source of energy in most diets. They include starches, fibre and sugars. Sweet foods such as sugar, jam, cakes and sugary drinks are sources of carbohydrates but should be consumed minimally because they do not provide any other nutrients and may increase risk of overweight. Carbohydrate requirements Individual carbohydrate requirements vary according to age, sex, phys- ical activity level and physiological status. The recommended daily carbohydrate intake should provide about 45% to 65% of the total body energy/calorie requirements of 2000 \u20133000 kilocalories (kcal). One gram of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories. Proteins Proteins are body-building foods and are required for growth and devel- opment, maintenance and repair of tissues, production of metabolic and digestive enzymes, and formation of certain hormones and all cells and tissues.",

During weaning there are six princi - ples to follow: meal frequency, amount, thickness, variety, active feeding and hygiene. This is commonly referred to as the FATVAH. 1. Frequency of meals refers to the number of meals eaten in a day. In order to meet the child\u2019s body\u2019s needs, for growth, development, and activity, we must feed them frequent meals, meaning 3 meals and 2 snacks each day. 2.

A healthier and stronger household is more economically viable and resilient in the face of nutritional chal - lenges. WASH practices benefit everyone, and integrating these prac- tices into nutrition care programs provides additional opportunities and resources to improve overall health outcomes. Water access \u2022 Access to safe water is considered a basic human need and, in most countries, a basic human right. \u2022 For many people especially in rural communities, there is lack ac-cess to safe water. \u2022 The negative effects of lack of access to sufficient quantities of water, water of reasonable quality, basic sanitation and hygiene are magnified for sick people including the malnourished clients. \u2022 The added burden of unsafe water affects not only the malnour - ished individual, but the entire family, increasing the risk of diar - rhoea disease and lost productivity. Water quality \u2022 Piped water is available in some areas, but is often untreated or is contaminated between the source and the home. \u2022 Simple, low cost technologies for treating and safely storing water at the household level can greatly improve the microbial quality of water and can significantly reduce diarrhoea achieving outcomes comparable to those achieved by hand washing and safe handling and disposal of faeces. \u2022 Several technologies are viable for treating water in the home: chlo - rination; use of aqua safe and water guard, use of various types of filters; proper boiling.",

Women with IDDs give birth to children with reduced ability to learn, lower school performance, higher rates of school-age repetition, and poor speech and hearing ability. What is especially tragic is that the effects of iodine deficiency are permanent. Because of IDD, in the year 2009 alone, 2,100 children were born as cretins in Uganda and likely will require 100 percent care in their entire lives, 59,000 children were born with mild or moderate mental disabil - ities and Uganda lost US$8.6 million in productivity (Uganda Profiles 2012).",
